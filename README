Instructions:

There are two modes of making the binaries:

1) make [mode=debug]
2) make mode=release

Mode (1) is the default mode and its execution is very slow,
because the code tests the iteration data after each major step for
each chosen algorithm.

Mode (2) is the right one if just the resulting image, or its timing,
is needed.

To clean the generated binaries of each case, use the following commands:

1) make [mode=debug] clean
2) make mode=release clean
